# ML_Diabetes_prediction
The project aims to identify if a person has Diabetes or not based on features like gender, age, hypertension, presence of heart disease and smoking history. This is a binary classification problem. Various classification algorithms were used to build models and their performances were compared to find the optimal model.
The following steps were followed :

1. Loading the dataset
2. Data preprocessing
3.  Data visualization
4.  Oversampling and undersampling to fix imbalanced dataset
5.  Model training for undersampled and oversampled dataset
6.  Plotting ROC curve

Results: An XGBoost classifier achieved the highest accuracy of 96.87% and AUC value of 1.00
